# codicentjs

To create a JavaScript file for injecting Codicent, I'll guide you through the process of creating a simple JavaScript file, obfuscating it, and hosting it on GitHub.

Step 1: Create the JavaScript file

Create a new file named codicent-inject.js with the following content:

(function (window) {
  window.Codicent = {
    // Your Codicent object properties and methods go here
    // For example:
    apiEndpoint: 'https://example.com/api',
    clientId: 'my-client-id',
    theme: 'light'
  };
})(window);
Replace the placeholder values with your actual Codicent object properties and methods.

Step 2: Obfuscate the JavaScript file

To obfuscate the JavaScript file, you can use a tool like UglifyJS or JavaScript Obfuscator. Here, I'll show you how to use UglifyJS.

Install UglifyJS using npm:

npm install uglify-js
Then, run the following command to obfuscate the codicent-inject.js file:

uglifyjs codicent-inject.js --output codicent-inject.min.js
This will generate a minified and obfuscated version of your JavaScript file, named codicent-inject.min.js.

Step 3: Host the file on GitHub

Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one. Create a new file in the repository by clicking the "New file" button.

Paste the contents of the codicent-inject.min.js file into the new file, and give it a name like codicent-inject.min.js.

Step 4: Serve the file using GitHub Pages (optional)

If you want to serve the file using GitHub Pages, you'll need to create a GitHub Pages site. Create a new file named index.html in the repository, and add the following content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="codicent-inject.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your page content -->
  </body>
</html>
Then, go to your repository settings, click "GitHub Pages" on the left, and set the GitHub Pages site to use the index.html file.

Step 5: Link to the file

Now, you can link to the obfuscated JavaScript file in your HTML pages using a script tag:

<script src="https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/codicent-inject.min.js"></script>
Replace your-username and your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name, respectively.

That's it! You've successfully created, obfuscated, and hosted your JavaScript file for injecting Codicent.
